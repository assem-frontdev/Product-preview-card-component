## My process

  I start the project by following the steps in the challenge. I started with the desktop version and then the mobile version. I struggle to center the card on the page at the beginning
  and then I use the flexbox and position absolute with the transform property to center horizontally and vertically along with the (top and left properties).
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I learned that to look closely at the details in the challenge because I take a lot of time to try to adjust the image in the mobile version and then I discover that
 I have two image versions one for desktop and the other for mobile. Also, I learned to be patient if things don't work from the first attempt 
and know how to make good research to find a solution to my issue.

### To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```


### Continued development

I will ensure to continue working on most of the free newbie challenges and also working on improving my skills in CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid.
